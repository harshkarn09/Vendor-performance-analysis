# Vendor Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing vendor performance metrics to optimize supply chain operations and make data-driven decisions regarding vendor relationships. Through detailed analysis of vendor data, we provide insights into performance metrics, delivery reliability, quality standards, and cost-effectiveness.

## Project Description
The Vendor Performance Analysis project utilizes data analytics and machine learning techniques to:
- Evaluate vendor reliability and performance metrics
- Analyze delivery times and consistency
- Assess quality standards and compliance
- Monitor cost-effectiveness and pricing trends
- Generate insights for vendor relationship management
- Provide data-driven recommendations for vendor selection

## Tech Stack
